## FinRisk AI Copilot - Current Status

‚úÖ **WORKING COMPONENTS:**
- Maven wrapper created and configured  
- Infrastructure services (Docker Compose) ready
- Project structure complete with all services
- Validation script created
- Development Makefile with commands

‚ö†Ô∏è  **DEPENDENCY ISSUES:**
- Some Python ML libraries have compatibility issues with Python 3.13
- Need to use compatible package versions

üöÄ **NEXT STEPS TO GET RUNNING:**

1. **Start Infrastructure Services:**
   ```bash
   cd infra/docker-compose && docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run Individual Services (that work):**
   ```bash
   # Java Case Service (WORKS)
   cd apps/case-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   
   # Node.js Gateway (WORKS)  
   cd apps/gateway-bff && npm start
   ```

3. **Fix Python Services Later:**
   - Use Python 3.11 or 3.12
   - Simplify ML dependencies
   - Add packages incrementally

## **IMMEDIATE WORKING DEMO:**

You can run this now to see the system infrastructure:
```bash
make start  # Starts all infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, etc.)
```

The foundation is solid - we just need to resolve package compatibility issues for the Python ML services.
